# Overview

This plugin accompanies [Minimal Theme](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal), allowing you to customize the theme from the Obsidian Settings panel. This plugin is not required to use Minimal Theme, but highly recommended.

# Usage

- Requires Minimal Theme
- Works hand-in-hand with [Hider Plugin](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider) to simplify the Obsidian UI by removing the menu ribbon, tooltips, title bar, scrollbars, etc. This functionality was previously included in Minimal Theme but has now been separated out.
